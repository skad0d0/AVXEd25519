## High-Throughput EdDSA Verification on Intel Processors with Advanced Vector Extensions

This repository contains the source code for the paper "High-Throughput EdDSA Verification on Intel Processors with Advanced Vector Extensions". The code provides the AVX2 implementation of the three methods discussed in the paper, enabling efficient EdDSA verification.

To compile the source code, use the make command:

```
make
```

Run the speed test to benchmark the implementation:

```
./test_bench
```

## Results

Refer to the paper for detailed results, comparisons, and insights on the performance of the implemented methods.
